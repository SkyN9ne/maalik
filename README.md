Network Pivoting | Forwards a Port to another Host on the network to forward exploit traffic onto it.
Enable / Disable Firewall | Enable or Disable Windows Firewall, Use full for pivoting scenarios. Firewall is automatically turned off during Pivot attack.
Network Scanner | Discover Hosts in the subnet.
Port Scanner | Scans discovered hosts for [common ports](https://github.com/quantumcored/maalik/blob/master/common_ports).
MS17-10 Network Scanner | Scans the network for Hosts vulnerable to MS17-10, The Eternal Blue.
Automatic Eternal Blue | Automatically runs metasploit using rc file to potentially exploit Port 445.
Reverse Shell | Stable Reverse Shell, Commands executed as ``cmd.exe /c <your input>``.
File upload / download | Upload or Download Files.
Reflective DLL Injection | Reflective DLL Injection into any process.
Screenshot | Take screenshot (``bmp=>png``).
GeoLocation | Geolocate Fhdawn.
SAM Dump | Dumps SAM and SYSTEM files to disk, Downloads and dumps them using ``samdump2``.


##### Dynamic Payload System (DPS). 
Note (This is incomplete, And was completed in a [different project](https://github.com/quantumcored/remote_hacker_probe), I may update this in the future.
Executes 'Payloads' in Memory using Reflective DLL Injection.
The Payload is a 32 bit Reflective DLL, That carries out tasks after successful Injection.
DLL output is written to a TEXT file named ``output.png`` which is used to smuggle output back to server, And also give the DLL Payload commands.

Payload | Description
--------|------------
(DPS) Reverse Shell | Netcat Reverse shell.
(DPS) Administrator Prompt Trigger | Forcefully attempt to Execute an Application as Administrator.
(DPS) Chrome Password Recovery | Dumps Saved Google Chrome passwords. (Does not work on latest version) :shipit:
(DPS) In Memory Meterpreter | Execute Metasploit C Shellcode.
(DPS) Keystroke logging | Log keystrokes.
(DPS) Capture Mic Input | Record Mic.
(DPS) Registry Persistence | Add any application to startup using registry keys.

##### CMD Post Exploitation Commands (CMD)
These are cmd commands that are useful in a post exploit situation. Not listed here.
- List users.
- View full System Information.
- View all Drivers.
- Get list of running processes.
- Get Available Drive Letters.
- Get all envoironment variables.
- Displays information about sessions on a Remote Desktop Session Host server.
